      "desc" : "Sigismund III Vasa, Polish Zygmunt Waza, Swedish Sigismund Vasa (born June 20, 1566, Gripsholm, Swed.—died April 30, 1632, Warsaw, Pol.), king of Poland (1587–1632) and of Sweden (1592–99) who sought to effect a permanent union of Poland and Sweden but instead created hostile relations and wars between the two states lasting until 1660.The elder son of King John III Vasa of Sweden and Catherine, daughter of Sigismund I the Old of Poland, Sigismund belonged to the Vasa dynasty through his father and to the Jagiellon dynasty through his mother, who brought him up as a Catholic. He was elected king of Poland in August 1587, succeeding his uncle King Stephen Báthory. To obtain the throne he had to accept a reduction of royal power and a consequent increase of the power of the Sejm (Diet). In 1592 he married the Austrian archduchess Anna, and, after his father’s death the same year, he received the Sejm’s permission to accept the Swedish throne. He was crowned king of Sweden in 1594, but only after promising to uphold Swedish Lutheranism.Leaving his paternal uncle Charles (later Charles IX) as regent in Sweden, Sigismund returned to Poland in July 1594. Charles, however, rose in rebellion, and, when Sigismund returned to Sweden with an army, Charles defeated him at Stångebro (1598) and deposed him in 1599. Sigismund’s subsequent foreign policy was aimed at regaining the Swedish throne, and from 1600 Poland and Sweden were involved in an intermittent war. He also attempted to maintain an alliance with the Austrian Habsburgs. When his first Austrian wife died (1598) and he married her sister Constantia (1605), he provoked his opponents, already aroused by his efforts to introduce majority rule in place of unanimity in the Sejm, to engage in a civil war (1606–08).Shortly after his victory over his internal enemies, Sigismund took advantage of a period of civil unrest in Muscovy (known as the Time of Troubles) and invaded Russia, holding Moscow for two years (1610–12) and Smolensk thereafter. In 1617 the Polish-Swedish conflict, which had been interrupted by an armistice in 1611, broke out again. While Sigismund’s army was also fighting Ottoman forces in Moldavia (1617–21), King Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden (Charles IX’s son) invaded Sigismund’s lands, capturing Riga (1621) and seizing almost all of Polish Livonia. Sigismund, who concluded the Truce of Altmark with Sweden in 1629, never regained the Swedish crown. His Swedish wars resulted, moreover, in Poland’s loss of Livonia and in a diminution of the kingdom’s international prestige.",

      "desc" : "Władysław IV Vasa, (born June 9, 1595, Kraków, Pol.—died May 20, 1648, Merecz), king of Poland (1632–48), a popular monarch who did much to heal the wounds and solve the problems created by his father, Sigismund III Vasa, an obstinate man and religious bigot who created internal friction in Poland and pursued a series of profitless wars abroad. Władysław sought to make Poland secure during a period of change in northern Europe and Russia.When Władysław was 15, his father manipulated the youth’s election as tsar of Russia while Polish forces held Moscow during the Time of Troubles following the death of Boris Godunov. His election, which never resulted in his assumption of the Muscovite throne, was part of an unsuccessful plan by Sigismund to conquer all of Russia and convert the population to Catholicism. As a young man Władysław showed ability as a military leader in operations against Muscovy (1617–18) and the Ottoman Empire (1621).He succeeded to the Polish throne on his father’s death in 1632. In an attempt to take advantage of confusion expected after the death of the Polish king, a Muscovite army of 40,000 crossed Poland’s eastern frontier and laid siege to Smolensk (ceded to Poland by Russia in 1618). Władysław broke the siege in March 1633 and then launched an offensive, capturing the Russian commander in February 1634. By the Peace of Polyanov that followed, Tsar Michael Romanov confirmed all earlier cessions of territory to Poland and agreed to pay 200,000 rubles in exchange for Władysław’s renunciation of all claims to the tsardom.Władysław then moved his army south and forced the Turks to come to terms with him. By agreement Poland and the Ottomans retained their respective control over the Cossacks and the Tatars, and the two countries shared joint suzerainty over Moldavia and Walachia.Władysław won an advantageous peace from Sweden in the Armistice of Stuhmsdorf in September 1635, following a war undertaken to exploit Sweden’s difficulties during the Thirty Years’ War. He failed, however, to find any method for regaining the Swedish crown, which had been held and then lost by his father. He suffered continuing difficulties caused by the efforts of the Polish Sejm (Diet) to check the King’s power and limit his dynastic ambitions. In 1637 Władysław married Cecilia Renata of Austria, sister of the Holy Roman emperor Ferdinand III. When she bore him a son, Sigismund Casimir, in 1640, Władysław once more tried to assert his personal power. His attempts to mediate between the warring German and Scandinavian powers came to nothing, and he finally planned to use the Cossacks to provoke the Turks into attacking Poland so that his military leadership would be indispensable. The plan, however, failed before it got underway. Brokenhearted at the death of his son in 1647, Władysław died at the moment when the Cossacks, angered because his promises had failed to materialize, were beginning their greatest revolt against Polish rule.",

Though he regained Poland’s former provinces of Podolia and the Ukraine, his reign marked the beginning of Poland’s decline as a European power.The second son of Elector John George III of Saxony, Augustus succeeded his elder brother John George IV as elector in 1694. After the death of John III Sobieski of Poland (1696), Augustus became one of 18 candidates for the Polish throne. To further his chances, he converted to Catholicism, thereby alienating his Lutheran Saxon subjects and causing his wife, a Hohenzollern princess, to leave him. Shortly after his coronation (1697) the “Turkish War,” which had begun in 1683 and in which he had participated intermittently since 1695, was concluded; by the Treaty of Carlowitz in 1699, Poland received Podolia, with Kamieniec (Kamenets) and the Ukraine west of the Dnieper River from the Ottoman Empire.Seeking to conquer the former Polish province of Livonia, then in Swedish hands, for his own Saxon house of Wettin, Augustus formed an alliance with Russia and Denmark against Sweden. Although the Polish Diet refused to support him, he invaded Livonia in 1700, thus beginning the Great Northern War (1700–21), which ruined Poland economically. In July 1702 Augustus’s forces were driven back and defeated by King Charles XII of Sweden at Kliszów, northeast of Kraków. Deposed by one of the Polish factions in July 1704, he fled to Saxony, which the Swedes invaded in 1706. Charles XII forced Augustus to sign the Treaty of Altranstädt (September 1706), formally abdicating and recognizing Sweden’s candidate, Stanisław Leszczyński, as king of Poland (see Altranstädt, treaties of). In 1709, after Russia defeated Sweden at the Battle of Poltava, Augustus declared the treaty void and, supported by Tsar Peter I the Great, again became king of Poland.When Russia intervened (1716–17) in an internal dispute between Augustus and dissident Polish nobles (Confederation of Tarnogród) and, in 1720, annexed Livonia, the king saw the danger of Russia’s growing influence in Polish affairs. He tried unsuccessfully to create a hereditary Polish monarchy transmissible to his one legitimate son, Frederick Augustus II (eventually king of Poland as Augustus III), and to secure other lands for his many illegitimate children. But his hopes of establishing a strong monarchy came to naught. By the end of his reign, Poland had lost its status as a major European power, and when he died the War of the Polish Succession broke out. A man of extravagant and luxurious tastes, he did much to develop Saxon industry and trade and greatly embellished the city of Dresden.",
